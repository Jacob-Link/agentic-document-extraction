1. add versions to the env file packages
2. look at s3_uploader.py to generate smarter filename, maybe call llm here
3. ensure high quality logging (time taken, what the agent is doing at any time...)
4. endure the sequence works:
"""
docker-compose up -d
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/extract \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"url": "https://caleprocure.ca.gov/event/0850/0000036230",
"s3_bucket": "test-bucket", "s3_prefix": "test/"}'
"""
